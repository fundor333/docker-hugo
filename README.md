`fundor333/hugo` is a [Docker](https://www.docker.io) base image for static sites generated with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) fork from `publysher/hugo`.

Images derived from this image can either run as a stand-alone server, or function as a volume image for your web server.

For my personal use I make smaller the image of _publysher_ because I use it in my automation service and I want a more fast pipeline.

## Prerequisites

The image is based on the following directory structure:

```txt
 .
 ├── Dockerfile
 └── site
     ├── config.toml
     ├── content
     │   └── ...
     ├── layouts
     │   └── ...
     └── static
  └── ...
```

In other words, your Hugo site resides in the `site` directory, and you have a simple Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM fundor333/hugo
```

## Building your site

Based on this structure, you can easily build an image for your site:

```sh
docker build -t my/image .
```

Your site is automatically generated during this build.

## Using your site

There are two options for using the image you generated:

- as a stand-alone image
- as a volume image for your webserver

Using your image as a stand-alone image is the easiest:

```sh
docker run -p 1313:1313 my/image
```

This will automatically start `hugo server`, and your blog is now available on <http://localhost:1313>.

If you are using `boot2docker`, you need to adjust the base URL:

```sh
docker run -p 1313:1313 -e HUGO_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_DOCKER_IP:1313 my/image
```

The image is also suitable for use as a volume image for a web server, such as [nginx](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)

```sh
docker run -d -v /usr/share/nginx/html --name site-data my/image
docker run -d --volumes-from site-data --name site-server -p 80:80 nginx
```
